# Real-Time-Vehicle-Routing-Algorithm
The real time vehicle routing algorithm will be implemented using multithreading. There are applications for real time vehicle routing which could be solved faster when computed in parallel, thereby increasing the computational power beyond what is available with sequential computers.
